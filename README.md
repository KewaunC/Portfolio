This is my porfolio and in it I show of projects I am most proud of in terms of functionality 

How its Made: Its made with HTML, CSS, JS

Focus for making this: I just wanted to challenge myself and show of works I've done

What could I have optimized: Media Queries, adding more projects into my portfolio instead of highlighting just 4

Lessons Learned: Since I created this without using a template I would say the most challenging parts were definattely postioning and breaking old habits of px and using grid and flex
